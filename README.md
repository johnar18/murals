Final website project for FOLK 476

(A/N: I know that there's a lack of folders here. I know it's terrible for organization, but it was easier for uploading, okay?)

Walk through the pages where you could a variant of the following:
index.html / home: introduction, why murals and graffiti are great

look.html / the eyes of a folklorist, including: the literature review, what they studied/believe, comparison to other art forms (song, dance, etc.), portraiture vs mural

mm.html / murals from the masters: messages, the struggles, murals vs gallery work, examples, Banksy

gg.html / graffiti from the greats: skills, thoughts, vandalism vs art, Marc Eck≈ç's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure

campus.html / campus culture: folklore around campus, pics of murals/graffiti around campus, how Chapel Hill is affected, MB 

cited.html / researched sources: duh, sources
